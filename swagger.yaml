  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    The **Mail Sender API** is a lightweight and easy-to-use RESTful API built with Node.js and Express for sending emails.

    This API uses [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) under the hood and is ideal for:
    - Contact forms
    - Notification systems
    - Custom email flows (like verification or onboarding)

    ### Features:
    - 📧 Send transactional or custom emails
    - 🔒 Secured with environment-based SMTP credentials
    - 📝 Auto-generated documentation using Swagger UI

    ### Authentication:
    - This API does not require token-based authentication by default.
    - You can integrate OAuth, API Keys, or session auth if needed.

    > 🔧 Make sure to set your SMTP config via environment variables before using.
